FOUNDER_DESC8=Hi guys,
FOUNDER_DESC9=Here are Aga and Sun, most of you already know us for years and some of you probably just found us on the internet today. We are the founders of the Chinese Cooking Workshop (CCW), the only full time hands-on cooking workshop in Shanghai since 2003.
FOUNDER_DESC10=In the year of 2003, when we were at early 20s, we established the Chinese Cooking Workshop in Shanghai. The whole idea was based on one of the questions asked very often by our expats friends, \u2018where can we learn some Chinese cooking since we are in China?\u2019. With a second business thought to this question, Sun and I were seriously talking about the possibilities to launch the cooking workshop in Shanghai by ourselves.
FOUNDER_DESC11=After many talks between us and many talks to our chef friends, with their support ( always\! ) we found a local cooking school which is also very supportive to our ideas  -  open a hands-on cooking program for expats who are working, living and travelling to Shanghai. That was Nov. 2003. Our first cooking lesson was on one of the Sundays in Nov. 2003, we\u2019ve got 2 students only. No bad for a start, right?
FOUNDER_DESC12=In 2005/6, we found that we got to have our own kitchen, instead of working together with the local chinese cooking schools lack of flexibilities , one of the main reasons was we\u2019ve got more and more requests from our guests that they would like to have the cooking lessons not only over the weekend but also the week days, or in a word, anytime they are free and they are interested.
FOUNDER_DESC13=So in 2005/6, we\u2019ve got our own kitchen in Shanghai. Now we could accommodate our guests anytime they want.
FOUNDER_DESC14=In the year of 2008, we notice more and more companies / travelling agencies / local organizations / international schools keep sending their guests / students /  team members for big group cooking events with us, we realize that it\u2019s the time to move to the much bigger space for you guys.
FOUNDER_DESC15=In all these 8 years, we\u2019ve been very lucky to have a great cooking team with us all the time, they are friendly and professional, they receive tons of thanks note, positive feedbacks from you guys, our dearest guests. All these years, you keep us delivering best cooking experience we could ever be able to offer.
FOUNDER_DESC16=Xiexie * you guys! Hope to see you more in our kitchens.
FOUNDER_DESC17=* xiexie, Chinese word for \u2018thanks\u2019.
